        <h1>HI I AM ISHAAN AND MY FAVORITE HOBBY IS PLAYING CRICKET</h1>
        <p>I play cricket after finishing my homework afterschool and I like it a lot. Why you ask? I will love any sport but i like cricket more than the others because i love getting boundaries and hitting balls. I get happy when I take a catch or get a bold. It is also a way to get a ton of exercise while having fun. I also watch international cricket and my favorite player is Mahendra Singh Dhoni but he recently retired from international cricket. My favorite team is India and they have won the world cup 2 times tied with West Indies. Cricket is also the second most popular sport in the world behind soccer.</p>
